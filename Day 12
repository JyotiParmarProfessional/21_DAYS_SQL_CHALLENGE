Topics: NULL handling, IS NULL, IS NOT NULL, COALESCE

## Practice Questions:

1. Find all weeks in services_weekly where no special event occurred.
2. Count how many records have null or empty event values.
3. List all services that had at least one week with a special event.

Question: 
Analyze the event impact by comparing weeks with events vs weeks without events. Show: event status ('With Event' or 'No Event'), count of weeks, average patient satisfaction, and average staff morale. Order by average patient satisfaction descending.


***Query 
#1
select week from services_weekly
where event = 'none';

#2
select count(*)as null_count from services_weekly
where event is null
or event = '';

#3
select  distinct service,week , event from services_weekly
where event is not null
and event != 'none' and event != ' ';

Challenge Question
select case when event is null or event = 'none' then 'No Event'
else 'With Event' end as event_status, 
count(week), round(avg(patient_satisfaction),2), round(avg(staff_morale),2) from services_weekly
group by event_status
order by avg(patient_satisfaction);
