### Practice Questions:

1. Find patients who are in services with above-average staff count.
2. List staff who work in services that had any week with patient satisfaction below 70.
3. Show patients from services where total admitted patients exceed 1000.

### Daily Challenge:

Find all patients who were admitted to services that had at least one week where patients were refused AND the average patient satisfaction for that service was below the overall hospital average satisfaction. Show patient_id, name, service, and their personal satisfaction score.

***Queries


#1.
with staff_count as(select service, count(*) as total_staff from staff 
group by service),
staff_avg as(select service from staff_count 
where total_staff > (select avg(total_staff) from staff_count))
select p.patient_id, p.name, p.service from patients p
join staff_avg s on p.service = s.service;

#2.
select distinct s.staff_id, s.staff_name, s.service from staff s join services_weekly sw 
on sw.service = s.service
where patient_satisfaction < 70;

#3.
WITH service_totals AS (
    SELECT service, SUM(patients_admitted) AS total_admitted
    FROM services_weekly
    GROUP BY service
    HAVING SUM(patients_admitted) > 1000
)
SELECT p.patient_id, p.name, p.service
FROM patients p
JOIN service_totals st
    ON p.service = st.service;


Daily Challenge Question:
select p.patient_id, p.name, p.service, p.satisfaction from patients p 
where p.service in (select service from services_weekly sw 
where sw.service in (select distinct service from services_weekly 
where patients_refused > 0) group by sw.service having avg(sw.patient_satisfaction) 
< (select avg(patient_satisfaction) from services_weekly));
