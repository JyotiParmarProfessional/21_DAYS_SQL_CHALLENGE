### Practice Questions:

1. Categorise patients as 'High', 'Medium', or 'Low' satisfaction based on their scores.
2. Label staff roles as 'Medical' or 'Support' based on role type.
3. Create age groups for patients (0-18, 19-40, 41-65, 65+).

### Daily Challenge:

Create a service performance report showing service name, total patients admitted, and a performance category based on the following: 'Excellent' if avg satisfaction >= 85, 'Good' if >= 75, 'Fair' if >= 65, otherwise 'Needs Improvement'. Order by average satisfaction descending.


***Queries:

#1.
select *, 
case when satisfaction <70 then 'Low'
     when satisfaction between 70 and 85 then 'Medium'
     else 'High' end satisfaction_score
 from patients;


#2.
select *, 
   case when role = 'doctor' then 'Medical'
   else 'Support' end as label_type
     from staff;


#3.
select *, 
  case when age  between 0 and 18 then '0-18'
  when age  between 19 and 40 then '19-40'
  when age  between 41 and 65 then '41-65'
  else '65+ '
  end as age_group 
from patients;


#Challenge:

select 
     service, 
     count(patients_admitted) as total_admit,
     case when avg(patient_satisfaction)>= 85 then 'Excellent'
     when avg(patient_satisfaction)>= 75 then 'Good'
     when avg(patient_satisfaction)>= 65 then 'Fair'
     else 'Needs Improvement' end as satisfaction_review
from services_weekly
group by service;




order by avg(patient_satisfaction) desc;
