### Practice Questions:

1. Extract the year from all patient arrival dates.
2. Calculate the length of stay for each patient (departure_date - arrival_date).
3. Find all patients who arrived in a specific month.

### Daily Challenge:

**Question:** Calculate the average length of stay (in days) for each service, showing only services where the average stay is more than 7 days. Also show the count of patients and order by average stay descending.


***Queries:

#1.
select *, extract(year from arrival_date)as year from patients;


#2.
select *, datediff(departure_date, arrival_date)as stay from patients;


#3.
select * from patients
where month(arrival_date) = 3;

#Challenge:


select service, round(avg(datediff(departure_date, arrival_date)), 0)as stay, count(*) from patients
group by service
having stay > 7
order by stay desc;
