Topics: LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, including unmatched records

### Practice Questions:

1. Show all staff members and their schedule information (including those with no schedule entries).
2. List all services from services_weekly and their corresponding staff (show services even if no staff assigned).
3. Display all patients and their service's weekly statistics (if available).


### Daily Challenge:

Create a staff utilisation report showing all staff members (staff_id, staff_name, role, service) and the count of weeks they were present (from staff_schedule). Include staff members even if they have no schedule records. Order by weeks present descending.

select s.staff_id, s.staff_name, s.role, s.service, ss.week from staff_schedule ss
right join staff s on s.staff_id = ss.staff_id;


#2.
select sw.week, sw.service, sw.patients_admitted, sw.patients_request, sw.patients_refused  ,s.staff_name from services_weekly sw
left join staff s on s.service = sw.service;


#3.
select p.patient_id, p.name, p.service, sw.week, sw.patients_request, sw.patients_refused  from patients p 
left join services_weekly sw on p.service = sw.service;


#Challenge Question:


select s.staff_id, s.staff_name, s.role, ss.service, count(ss.week) as total_week from staff s 
left join staff_schedule ss  on s.staff_id = ss.staff_id
group by s.staff_id, s.staff_name, s.role, ss.service
