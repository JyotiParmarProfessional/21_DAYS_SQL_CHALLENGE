Topics: UPPER, LOWER, LENGTH, CONCAT, SUBSTRING

### Practice Questions:

1. Convert all patient names to uppercase.
2. Find the length of each staff member's name.
3. Concatenate staff_id and staff_name with a hyphen separator.


### Challenged Questions:

Create a patient summary that shows patient_id, full name in uppercase, service in lowercase, age category (if age >= 65 then 'Senior', if age >= 18 then 'Adult', else 'Minor'), and name length. Only show patients whose name length is greater than 10 characters.

***Queries

#1
select upper(name) from patients;

#2
select staff_name, length(staff_name) from staff;

#3
select concat(staff_id, "-", staff_name) from staff;

#Challenge:

select patient_id, upper(name), lower(service), 
case when age >= 65 then 'Senior'
when age >= 18 then 'Adult' else 'Minor'end as age_category, 
length(name)as name_length from patients
having name_length > 10;
